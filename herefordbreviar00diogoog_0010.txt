mount in the series of textual variants in the lower set of
notem these thus represent real differenoes of text frum the
Sarum book, though mmetimes the differentes are only due to
an obvious blunder. To call attention tn mere blandem, and tn
show that these are faithful repmductions ¹ns the original suni-effi,
and not mere misprints in this edition, an obelus is used—thus†.

with reg-ard tu the order in which the several component parts
uf the Breviary are here printed, it is to be obe-‚enred that in the
original edition the whole is compi-ised in seven sections, each
with a separate regist-21· ε (ι) the Kalendas, a single quii-eg, (2)·th·:
Psalter and Commune Sanctorum combined ; (3) the first hals m.-
Winter portien cf the Temporale; (4) vthe corresponding portion
uf the Sanctae-aim ( 5) the special service of the Dedicatiun
Festivah the services uf the Blessed virgin and of the Departed ς
(6) the Summer part of the Tssrnporale3 and (7) the corres-
ponding part os the Sam-torale. This is the order in which they
happen tu have been bound in the copy which has been chiefly
used ς but it is clear that the book was so printed in order to allow
not only ns its division into two volumus, each ns them containing
the first, second, and fifth sections, but also ns variety in the
arrangement of the various sections, The order adopted in the
present edition is different from this, sor the first volume contains
the first and second sections and the whole uf the Tesssporalc.
while the second will comprise the fifth. and the: whole of the
Samiramim it is merely a matter of convenience in. primii-ig.

With regard to the upper series os notes it is to he observet!
that they contain every material difference that exista between
the authorities: but unimportant ones—differences ns speliing‚
of order, and small differences of expression—are rint there
recorded: the tasi< ns so doing would have been too iah-carinus
and the result too confusing. Since the printed Breviary
represents a considerable advance on the rest. and in particular
contains far more in the way uf rubrical direntium, it was thought
well to indicate the passages that are peculial· tu it ς this is tinne
by enclosing thern between a single and a double asterisk.
